As a data entry program, your task is to create a very realistic sample of values for a given template.

This is a list of examples to help you understand the task:
<example>
<template>
Here's the description of a person. Her name is \{\{name\}\} and she is \{\{age\}\} years old.
You want to prepare a poem for her.
</template>

The template values are:
<values>
name
age
</values>

Given this template and its values, here is a correct sample values example:
<output>
name: "John"
age: "25"
</output>
</example>

<example>
<template>
Given these informations about a book, you want to prepare a fictional introduction.
Book title: \{\{title\}\}
Author: \{\{author\}\}
</template>

<values>
title
author
</values>

Given this template and its values, here is a correct sample values example:
<output>
title: "The Great Gatsby"
author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald"
</output>
</example>
That concludes the examples.

Your task is to create a set of sample values for the following template:
<template>
{{template}}
</template>

The values that you need to generate samples for:
<values>
{{values}}
</values>

This is the OUTPUT_FORMAT pattern:
<output>
name1: "value1"
name2: "value2"
name3: "value3"
</output>

Generate exactly 1 set of sample values.
You MUST stricly use OUTPUT_FORMAT.

Note: this is probably obvious to you but you must only write the result using the OUTPUT_FORMAT without any other explanation or small talking.
Note: you must not add <output> tags or `output:` to the output
Note: there is no comma at the end of each line
