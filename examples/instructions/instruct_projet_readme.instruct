Instruct Overview

What It Does
Instruct is a tool designed to help developers create high-quality instructions for AI models.

Main Pain Point
Instruct addresses the challenge of optimizing prompt quality to effectively use the smallest open-source large-language models. These smaller models, ranging from 7 to 20 billion parameters, are highly sensitive to the quality of the prompts, unlike larger models.

Detailed Overview

1. Introduction
Instruct is a new tool aimed at software developers to assist in creating high-quality instructions for AI models. It consists of two main components and is designed to optimize the use of language models, particularly smaller open-source models.

2. Problem Statement
Currently, interacting with AI models like GPTs requires providing a textual request that can range from 8,000 to 200,000 tokens. The quality of this content is crucial for text generation. Traditional tools like standard text editors are not well-suited for this specific task.

3. Objective of Instruct
The goal of Instruct is to produce high-quality instructions and allow developers to focus on constructing prompts that ensure a significant portion of the performance and quality of the results obtained from AI models. Instruct is especially useful for smaller models, which are more sensitive to prompt quality.

4. Components of Instruct
1. VS Code Extension: Facilitates the development of instructions with syntax highlighting and developer toolboxes.
2. Python Library: Allows executing a prompt to various destinations interpreted by different models, providing an evaluation of the results.

5. Usage and Benefits
Instruct is an open-source tool, accompanied by concrete examples to demonstrate its usage. It enables developers to create, launch, and evaluate high-quality prompts, thereby optimizing the use of language models. Examples include those created by prompt and instruction creators from companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, and others.

6. Conclusion
Instruct is an essential tool for developers looking to maximize the performance of smaller open-source language models through high-quality instructions.

This is a zoom into the details of the `vscode-instruct` project:
<Description of the vscode instruct project>

vscode-instruct is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides a simple way to create and manage instructions for Large Language Models.
It provides highlighting of the minimal instruct syntax to help you write instructions for any task you want to perform with a Large Language Model.

vscode-instruct is mainly taking advantage of the Jinja templating engine to provide a simple way to write instructions.
In addition to the syntax highlighting, it highlights the shebang use of the instruct file, which is used to specify the language models for which the instructions are written.
